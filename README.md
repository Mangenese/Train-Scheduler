# Train-Scheduler
A project that uses Firebase to input train times
A user can input what ever train they want into the field and add the remaining items for it to append to the top row.
The best part is that it is stored in firebase so you can see what others can see!
My image came from a google search named Hd forest.

Give it a try!
